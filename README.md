This was an exploritory project done between Chrismas and New Years. It is a basic demonstration of how HTMX can be used to create an interactive website that hardly uses any JS and minimum dependancies. The meat of the project revolves around what happens in:

routes/api.php and web.php 
resources/views/tasks
Http/Controllers/TaskController.php
